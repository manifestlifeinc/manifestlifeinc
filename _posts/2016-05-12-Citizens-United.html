<p><strong>Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission (2010)</strong></p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>In order to be recognized as a legal person in the United States, one is subject
to the rights and duties of a democratic system. The lawful characteristics and
qualities of an entity, or legal personality, is the prerequisite of
establishing legal capacity. The power of legal capacity creates the opportunity
for all persons – natural or juridical – to open bank accounts, buy property,
and to sue and be sued in their own name.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> Capacity is an aspect of status,
and once defined by natural or judicial personal law, persons can carry their
capacity around with them, in resemblance to a passport. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<p>Synecdoche, meaning simultaneously understanding, is a figure of speech that
creates a play on words by referring to something with a related concept. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>
For example, referring to a person as an “Einstein,” as it uses a particular
name to represent a class of people: geniuses. Similarly, in the context of
American politics, figures of speech have allowed groups of individuals, such as
corporations, to be treated as if they are persons.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> Naturalized persons such
as human beings, receive their personhood when they are physically born, whereas
juridical persons do so when they are incorporated in accordance with the
law.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> In conclusion, the mission of this essay is to 1. Provide the reader a
brief analysis of money, politics, and other influences, before, during, and
after the Court’s decision in <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>
(2010), and, 2. Offer insight toward a deep-rooted issue regarding the topic of
personhood within the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Overview</p>

<p>In a 5&#8211;4 vote, the justices who made up the Roberts Court during 2009 declared
that in the case of <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, the
government restriction on “independent” political spending by corporations and
unions was unconstitutional according to the First Amendment of the
Constitution.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> The Court also claimed that the anti-Clinton broadcast
Citizens United was attempting to broadcast should be allowed.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> The
appellant, hereon out known as “FEC,” had two major issues to bring forth, which
were presented “as applied”. Moreover, the arguments regarding independent
expenditures that Citizens United presented were considered to be unsustainable,
which therein the Court took upon itself to analyze the overly broad scope of
facial challenges.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

<p>As a result, the Court identified a compelling governmental interest limiting
political speech by corporations through the rational of anti-distortion. The
court also then rejected, through ideological philosophy, the anticorruption
rational introduced by the <em>Citizens United</em> case.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> Finally, the disclaimer,
disclosure and reporting requirements established by the 2002 Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act (hereon out known as “BCRA”) were upheld by the Court. This
is because cases such as <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em> (1976) and <em>McConnell v. FEC</em> (2003)
as applied to <em>Citizens United</em> established that the BCRA requirements imposed
no ceiling, or prevented anyone from publicly speaking.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>

<p>Historical Relevance and Past Precedents</p>

<p>Dating all the way back to 1907, the United States Federal Government has taken
regulatory measures meant to limit the influence of “money in politics”.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> As
economic and political ideas progressed and changed over time, modifications
were made to these regulations in order to protect the commonwealth.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> Some
of the most significant cases involving this issue were brought in front of the
Supreme Court during the second half of the 20th century. During this time, the
regulatory laws that limited corporate funding in presidential campaigns were
being reaffirmed in the outcomes of these cases and therefore further embedded
into the governmental system.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> However, controversy surrounding this issue
did not peak until over a century after it was introduced, during the Supreme
Court Term of 2009&#8211;2010, when an extremely controversial decision was made in
the infamous <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (FEC)</em> case.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) was passed in 1971 and was meant to
prohibit corporations and labor unions from “using their general treasury funds
to make electioneering communications or for speech that expressly advocates the
election or defeat of a federal candidate”.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> FECA also established the
option for corporate “Political Action Committees” or PACs who could continue to
collect funds – but only from voluntary stockholders or union members.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a>
Although “mostly” nonprofit corporation Citizens United had built a PAC worth
millions since its establishment in 1988, the corporation sought to release a
free video-on-demand film as well as TV ads promoting their film attacking 2008
presidential candidate Hilary Clinton.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> In doing so, Citizens United would
sue the FEC and challenge Section 203 of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act
(BCRA) and Section 441(b) of FECA.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> The BCRA was a modification of FECA that
“barred corporations and unions from paying for media that mentioned any
candidate in periods immediately preceding elections”.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>

<p>On January 21, 2010, when the U.S. Supreme Court Ruled (5&#8211;4) that laws
preventing corporations and unions from using general treasury funds violate the
First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech, it invalidated parts of BRCA
and FECA while also overturning in whole or in part two previous Supreme Court
Rulings: <em>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em> (1990) and <em>McConnell v.
Federal Election Commission</em> (2003).<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> In <em>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of
Commerce,</em> the Court held that the government could require for-profit
corporations to use PACS while engaging in electoral advocacy, which would then
be reiterated as a primary precedent in cases to come – up until <em>Citizens
United</em> in 2010.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> For instance, <em>McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</em>
applied that same principle to uphold BCRA’s restrictions on “electioneering
communications,” in order to preserve the integrity of the electoral process,
prevent corruption, and maintain individual citizens’ confidence in the federal
government.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> Finally, the <em>Citizens United</em> decision also “effectively
negates parts of the Court’s 2007 ruling in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life v. Federal
Election Commission”</em>.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>

<p>Concurring Opinions and Make-Up of The Court</p>

<p>In the case of <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em>, the Roberts Court had a total of five
concurring opinions. It is important for the reader to note that the Roberts
Court was appointed by President Bush and sought to be wholly conservative.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a>
Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority’s opinion with the support of five
Republican elected justices. The justices in support were Justice Kennedy,
Alito, Scalia, and Thomas (in part).<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a></p>

<p>The majority’s opinion primarily states that political speech is indispensible
from a democracy; moreover, “speech” is constitutionally interpreted by the
terms of speech not by the terms of the speaker. <a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> The opinion also states
that the First Amendment protects the associations of individuals, in addition
to the individual speaker. Therefore, corporations were associations of
individuals protected by the right of free speech.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> In addition, the
majority’s opinion detailed that the BCRA disclosures were constitutional
because 1. They justified governmental interests, and 2. Provided electorates
with valuable information, and 3. Felt irresponsible to prevent corruption due
to the protection of a free marketplace of ideas.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a></p>

<p>The minority, represented by Justice Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayer
argued that the First Amendment only protects individual speech.<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> Democracy
in the United States has become increasingly watered down due to the
overwhelming influence corporations hold in elections. The next concurring
opinion represented Justice Roberts, joined by Alito, describes the judicial
restraint and stare decisis: “Judging the constitutionality of an act of
Congress is the gravest and most delicate duty that this court is called upon to
perform”.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a> Justice Scalia authored the third concurring opinion, with the
support of Justices Alito and Thomas. In this opinion, Justice Stevens’ view of
the framers’ interpretation was criticized. The final concurring opinion came
from Justice Thomas, who argued that anonymous free speech should be protected
by the Constitution. <a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a></p>

<p>Legacy</p>

<p><em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> is historically significant because of the dangerous
impact large corporations can have on politics when they are granted the same
rights as ordinary citizens – the effects of which we are living with today.
According to the article “What is Citizens United? | An Introduction,” an
explosion in independent political spending ensued in the aftermath of <em>Citizens
United</em>.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> So much so that in the first presidential election following the
decision (2012) there was more than twice the political spending [than] any
previous election; “independent political spending of the kind <em>Citizens United</em>
allows accounted for all of that increase”.<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> Some would go as far to say
that in this decision, the Supreme Court “unleashed a flood of corporate money
into our political system by announcing that corporations have a constitutional
right to spend unlimited amounts of money to promote or defeat candidates”.<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a>
Overall, the Court’s ruling dramatically enhanced the role of corporations and
unions while simultaneously narrowing the views they represent – ultimately
undermining the role of political parties in determining who will hold public
office. <a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a></p>

<p>While many Americans criticized the <em>Citizens United</em> decision as an
“overreaching attempt to rewrite campaign finance law,” others perceived the
decision as a “resounding victory for freedom of speech”.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> The Court’s
decision in <em>Citizens United</em> went against a number of precedents that had
long-established limitations and regulations on corporate spending in politics,
and the case is therefore considered “one of the most divisive decisions of the
Court in recent years”.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> Nonetheless, the majority of justices in the
Supreme Court during this case were determined to uphold the First Amendment of
the Constitution by protecting corporations’ “freedom of speech.”</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Further court rulings on the topic of money and politics have been explored
since the Court’s decision in <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> (2010). For example, the
case of <em>SpeechNow v. FEC</em> (2010) followed in light of the Supreme Court’s
decision in <em>Citizens United</em> – specifically the notion that the government has
no anti-corruption interest in limiting independent expenditures.<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> The Court
ruled, “contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures cannot
corrupt or create the appearance of corruption”.<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> As a result, the court of
appeals held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting
contributions to an independent group such as SpeechNow.<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> Contribution
limits as applied to SpeechNow “violate the First Amendment by preventing
individuals from donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits and by
prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting donations in excess of the limits”.<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, the plaintiffs in the case, <em>SpeechNow,</em> asked the Court to find the
contribution limits, reporting requirements and political committee registration
requirements unconstitutional as applied to their proposed activities. The
plaintiffs also requested that the court preliminarily and permanently enjoin
the FEC from enforcing these provisions against SpeechNow and the individual
plaintiffs.<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a> On March 26, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit ruled in <em>SpeechNow.org v. FEC</em> that, “the contribution
limits of 2 U.S.C. 441a are unconstitutional as applied to individuals’
contributions to SpeechNow”.<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a> The court also ruled that the reporting
requirements of 2 U.S.C. 432, 433 and 434(a) and the organizational requirements
of 2 U.S.C 431(4) and 431(8) can be constitutionally applied to SpeechNow.<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a></p>

<p>Following the ruling of <em>Speechnow v. FEC</em>, then came the topic of electoral
financing. In <em>McComish v. Bennett</em> (2011)<em>,</em> the Supreme Court deemed an
Arizona law that provided extra taxpayer-funded support for office seekers who
have been outspent by privately funded campaigns.<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a> An article published by
CNN reports:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A conservative 5&#8211;4 majority of justices said the law violated free speech,
 concluding the state was impermissibly trying to ‘level the playing field’
 through a public finance system. Arizone lawmakers had argued there was a
 compelling state interest in equalizing resourcs among competing candidates
 and interest groups”. <a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of this decision, states and municipalities are prevented from using
a source of public financing.<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a> All in all, the ruling meant the end of
similar fundraising programs in Connecticut, Maine and several other states.
<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a></p>

<p>In <em>Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana,</em> the
state of Montana believed that they had a compelling reason to maintain
restrictions regarding the limitation of corporate contributions.<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a> However,
the Supreme Court of Montana determined that the case of <em>Citizens United</em> had
already precluded the legal issue, and this case offered no new arguments and
failed to distinguish that prior decision.<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a> In addition to limiting the size
of donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign
Act (1971) also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual
may give to all candidates and parties. The most recent case regarding campaign
finance law was decided in <em>McCutcheon v. FEC.</em> In 2012, Sean McCutcheon, who is
a Republican Party activist, sought to donate more than was allowed by the
federal aggregate limits on federal candidates.<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a> In 2014, the Supreme Court
reversed a ruling that struck down and invalidated aggregate limits, but not the
limits on giving to any one candidate or party.<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, the issues of independent expenditure will only continue to grow
larger for our democracy. I believe that the only way for campaign finance law
to function sustainably is by differentiating the subject of “personhood”
through an entity’s ability to exercise independent freewill. By adding a new
amendment that excludes for-profit corporations from being protected by the
First Amendment in the same manner as individual citizens, I believe that our
democracy can be restored.</p>
